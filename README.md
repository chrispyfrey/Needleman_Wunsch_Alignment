# Needleman_Wunsch_Alignment


This program takes in two DNA or protein sequences, an associated substitution matrix, and a gap penalty value as input. Based on the input, this program provides an optimal pairwise alignment and score of the sequences based on an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch highroad algorithm.

## How to use
This program expects text documents as command line arguments as follows: <sequence_file.txt> <substitution_file.txt> <gap penalty value>

The output file is located in the 'results' directory.
